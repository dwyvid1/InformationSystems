## About the Project
This site serves as a personal repository for storing and organizing the knowledge I have gained during my undergraduate studies in Information Systems. The goal is to create an accessible and well-structured database that compiles study materials, class notes, projects, and relevant resources. Through this site, I aim to not only review and consolidate what I have learned but also to share and collaborate with others interested in the field of Information Systems.
